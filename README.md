# Topic modelling for posts on Vkontakte featuring University of Tyumen

The project is created for Master Thesis "The Place of Big Data Analytics in STI Policy Evaluation Process" in order to show an example of working with social media data for effects evaluation of Russian 5-100 project. The first part represents parsing vk.com with the help of its open access API, and the second one includes data processing, model creation and training as well as results analysis.

### NB
The process of topic modelling and results analysis was copied from here: https://github.com/DmitrySerg/open-data/tree/master/russian-parlament-2021 with minor changes. 
I do not claim any rights for this part of the project.
